## Ahsan Rasul

I am a dynamic and enthusiastic individual, who enjoys meeting challenges and solving problems, as a team or as an individual. Since graduating from university, I have worked for various aerodynamic testing facilities.

I had always been interested in computer systems and had always wanted to pursue a career in programming, so that when [Makers Academy](https://www.makers.tech/) was recommended to me I realised that their software development bootcamp was the perfect next step.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner
- During my at RWDI, I was able to quickly pick up the necessary skills for my role, such that when the Senior Wind Tunnel Operator left within 3 months of me starting, I was the sole Windtunnel Operator, and was able to maintain the busy testing schedule. While at A.R.A. i was able to impress my team leader with the speed that I learnt to operate the transonic windtunnel, that I recieved a payrise as soon as my probation period was over. 


#### Attention to Detail
- Between working at RWDI, A.R.A., learning to code and my time painting miniatures, I have learnt to pay attention to the details, to ensure the desired outcome.  This also comes through in debugging and problem solving, where my use of console logs is well known in my coding groups.

#### Socialiable
- As an avid boardgamer attending meetups means meeting new people to play with, and as such requires good social skills

#### Team Player
- I am able to fit myself around the team as required, and pair programming has allowed me to develop my communication and problem solving skills.  


## Hobbies

I am an avid RPG player and boardgamer, enjoying the social interaction therein. I also enjoy playing strategy based computer games. One of my favourite ways to unwind is to paint miniature figures.
